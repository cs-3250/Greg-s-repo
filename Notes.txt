    Post everything on repo
    one notes, file with each name
    1st test - 5 dys and head first design patterns

    presentation?

    pulled from child's report card, extrapolated into slides

            "if it was easy, we wouldn't do it. If it was repetitive, we wouldn't be paid well to do it."
        participate in class discussions
        engaged listener
        follows written and oral directions
        completes work in a timely manner - this is huge
            emphasis on procrastination - this career needs 'front loading'
        works independently
        responsible for belongings and property
        asks for help when needed
        produces neat, accurate, quality work

        completes timely, accurate homework
        uses good organizational skills
        demonstrates technology skills 
        uses library media to enhance

    hundreds of tests are needed, documentation
    in general, in field, 20% of time is spent coding
    learning multiple languages is crucial
    "never write searches, trees, linked lists, again"
    "steal liberally, but cite liberally"
        in comment add link and description of where each piece was from

    Recommendations from former students:
        Weekends don't help, manage your time, life always intrudes
        prove what you did
        over communicate, tag each sprint at the end - talk about this by end
        you are too optimistic
        budget for research, platform shifts, and for process, estimating points is very difficult
        physical sprint planning meetings are much more useful
        stay focused on current sprints
        always build and manually test the app, even if it seems changes in PR(pull request) are minor

    SME's - subject matter experts
        interact with customer and bring info to team

    Manager - hiring firing, etc.
    Scrum Master - 
    Product Owner

    **Require two reviewers to complete a pull request**
    XP - extreme programming
        2 people, one keyboard and mouse
        more knowledgable person driving
        less knowl. does typing

    Brookes Law - adding more people to a late project makes it later.
        communication lines add an N^2 problem

    Comments are a bad idea, you should be able to understand your code without explanation
        refactor the code, make it readable
        **Method decomposition**
        if your method has more than 7 functional parts, its too hefty

    user stories from product backlog,   
    Sprint backlog should have pieces that can be completed in one day
    definition of done, into doing

    first sprint is done this thursday
    pep8 - spaces, not tabs, 2 empty spaces between methods, etc.

    Personal note:
        need to talk with group about github functionality (pull requests)
    Slides/presentation
        open source software - influence in areas of interest
        "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" - closed source software is a cathedral, open is the Bazaar
        messaging apps - wats app (africa/india), we chat (china)
            facebook bought watsApp
        software systems are among the most complex ever created by humans
        SLOC - source lines of code
        bugs in code
            undergrad - every 10 lines of code
            professional - every 100 lines of code
            master (in the stride after professional) - every 1000 lines
        "Use other people's stuff as much as possible"
            less code writing means less bugs
